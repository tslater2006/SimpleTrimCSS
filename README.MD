## What this is 
This is a simple Chrome Extension for use in a workflow similar to what Andreas Kling follows when making a reduced test case for a Ladybird issue.

## Prereqs
It is assumed that you have already used a tool like Save Page WE in Firefox to download the current page as a single HTML file.

## How to use
Clone this repository and then load this extension into Chrome as an unpacked extension.

Open the page you have saved using Save Page WE in Chrome and proceed to cull as many elements as you can to get to a reduced test case.

Once you are satisified with the reduction in elements, click on the Trim CSS extension icon. 

Save the page using Chromes "Save"
